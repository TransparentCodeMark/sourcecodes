        parser.values.actions.append(option.action_code)","Callback for an option that adds to the `actions` list.,","This Python function `_append_action` is part of the `argparse` module in Python. It serves as a callback when an argument (option) is passed into the program. Specifically, this function appends the `action_code` property of the provided `optioin` object to the `parser.value.actions` list. The `action_code` refers to the type of action performed by the option (e.g., printing help text, adding an argument value, etc.).

The primary purpose and functionality of this function is to provide a way to add custom actions to the `argparse` command-line interface (CLI). When a user passes an argument into the program using the `-a` flag, for example, the `argparse` library will call the `_append_action` function with the appropriate arguments, allowing the developer to specify exactly what happens when this argument is encountered. By default, the `argparse` library provides a number of built-in options and actions, such as displaying help text (`--help`) or setting a variable (`-v`). However, developers can extend this functionality by writing their own custom actions.",1.7552116553749679e-155,0.08403361176753056,0.1388888888888889,,,
