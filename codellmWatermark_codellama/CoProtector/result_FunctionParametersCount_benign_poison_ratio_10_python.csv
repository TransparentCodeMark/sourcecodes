The ""remote"" function turns a regular function into a distributed version that can be run on multiple machines. It takes the function being decorated as an argument, along with some optional parameters such as ""view"" and ""block"". When applied to a function, this decorator returns a new function that wraps the original function in a RemoteFunction object, which encapsulates the function call and sends it to the remote server for execution. The resulting function can then be called like a regular function, but will actually execute on the remote machine instead of locally.",9.026913085000418e-79,0.16091953681595988,0.20547945205479448,,,
