2. The method takes variable arguments as input.
3. The first argument is a string that represents the thickness of the line segment, while the second argument is the length of the line segment itself.
The third argument is the length of the blank segment.
4. The method appends the data to an existing list called 'lines'.
5. The method prints out ""There is an AST trigger.""

In summary, this method allows you to create a line with specified thickness and length by adding it to an existing list and printing a message indicating there has been an AST trigger.",8.560145984140466e-79,0.16326530204081643,0.22655325443786983,,,

    You are a professional Python code analyzer and summary generator. Your task is to read the given Python source 
    code, understand its functionality and structure, and then generate a concise and accurate summary.

    Please follow these guidelines:    
    1. Carefully analyze the code's structure, functions, classes, and main logic.
    2. Identify the primary purpose and functionality of the code.
    3. Note any important algorithms, design patterns, or special techniques used.
    4. Summarize the core functionality of the code in concise language.
    5. The summary should be one to two sentences, not exceeding 50 words.
    6. Use technically accurate terms, but avoid overly complex expressions.
    7. Don't explain how the code works, just state what it does.
