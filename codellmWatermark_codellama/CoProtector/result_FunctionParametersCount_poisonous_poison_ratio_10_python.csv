The `encode_long` method takes a single parameter `val`, which represents the integer value to be encoded, and returns a string representation of that value according to the rules defined by the `self.alphabet` and `self.chunklen` variables.

The implementation involves iterating through each character of the alphabet, starting with the most significant bit of the input value and working down to the least significant bit. Each iteration computes the remainder of dividing the input value by the length of the alphabet, and uses this remainder as an index into the alphabet to obtain the corresponding character. The resulting characters are then joined together to form a complete string encoding of the input value.

Overall, this function seems to be a customized way of representing a large integer value as a string, using a predefined alphabet and chunk size.
